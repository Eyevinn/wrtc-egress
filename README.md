Server endpoint for standardized WebRTC based streaming. Currently supports the following egress / playback protocol:
- WHPP: [WebRTC HTTP Playback Protocol](https://github.com/Eyevinn/webrtc-http-playback-protocol/blob/master/webrtc-http-playback-protocol.md)

And support for the following SFUs:
- Symphony Media Bridge (`SfuType.smb`)

![Example of a setup using WHIP and WHPP](docs/webrtc_egress_endpoint.png)

## Usage

Install library

```
npm install --save @eyevinn/wrtc-egress
```

### WHPP Example

Use WHPP as egress protocol and Symphony Media Bridge as SFU.

```javascript
import { WHPPEndpoint, SfuType } from "@eyevinn/wrtc-egress";

const endpoint = new WHPPEndpoint({
  port: 8001,
  hostname: "wrtc-edge.eyevinn.technology",
  prefix: "/whpp",
  sfuAdapter: SfuType.smb,
  sfuOptions: { smbUrl: "http://localhost:8080/conferences/" },
  iceServers: [{ urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" }],
});
endpoint.listen();
```

When running an HTTP API for managing the channel is available at `/api/channels` by default. 

Access to WHPP endpoint at `/whpp/channels`.

## API

| Resource Â | HTTP Method | Description |
| --------  | ------ | ----------- |
| `/api/docs` | GET | Online API docs |
| `/api/channels/:channelId` | POST | Create a new channel |
| `/api/channels/:channelId` | DELETE | Delete a channel |
